# 45 Days DSA Challenge
Welcome to the 45 Days DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Challenge repository! This repository is created to track my progress and solutions as I work through various coding problems on LeetCode over the next 45 days.

# About
This challenge aims to improve my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms and data structures. Each day, I will solve a set of problems categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) on LeetCode. This repository will contain:

* Solutions to the daily problems in Java Explanation of the approach and thought process behind solving each problem
* Time and space complexity analysis
# Motivation
The primary motivation behind this challenge is to:

* Consistently practice problem-solving to enhance my skills
* Gain familiarity with common data structures and algorithms
* Prepare for technical interviews by tackling a variety of problems
